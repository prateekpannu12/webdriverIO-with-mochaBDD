### WebdriverIO-v6 automationpractice.com code with Mocha Hybrid(BDD and TDD)

### Installation
This project is tested on **Node v12.0.0** and above.  While earlier versions of node may be compatible, but they have not been verified.

`Node.JS:` Install  from the site - https://nodejs.org/en/  take the LTS version based on your Operating system. Please make sure you install NodeJS globally. To take full advantage of the command line and use grunt tasks you will need to make sure that you have added `node_modules/.bin` to your `$PATH`.  Otherwise you will need to install `npm install -g  grunt-cli` globally.


`JDK 1.8:` It is optional, install JDK 1.8+ and make sure class path is set properly. JAVA is require to start `Selenium Server` on your local environment nothing else.


### Run Some Sample Tests

To execute the sample test in local development, you can use one options mentioned below

Option 1: `npm wdio run ./wdio.conf.js`.

### Config Files

WebdriverIO uses configuration files to setup and execute tests in specific ways.  The configuration is fully customizable, and different functions can be invoked before, during and after each test or test suite.  Config files end with `*.conf.js`.  These can be called via the the cli

### Reporters

WebdriverIO uses several different types of test reporters to communicate pass/failure.

##### Spec

Test reporter, that prints detailed results to console.

### Develop automation scripts (for both desktop browser and mobile browser / app)

Refer complete [WebdriverIO v6 API](https://webdriver.io/docs/api.html) methods to write your automation tests.

#### Using Mocha JavaScript framework

Tests are written in the Mocha framework. More about Mocha can be found at  https://mochajs.org/

Tests are place in `*.specs.js` files in the `/test/specs/` directory. A typical test will look similar to this:
```
//example.js
//a simple test using synchronous mode//

describe('WebdriverIO search', function() {

    it('searches for WebdriverIO', function() {
        browser.url('https://duckduckgo.com/');
        $('#search_form_input_homepage').setValue('WebdriverIO');
        $('#search_button_homepage').click();
        var title = browser.getTitle();
        console.log('Title is: ' + title);
    });
});

```
### The Page Object Design Pattern

```
const Page = require('./page');
class LoginPage extends Page {

    /**
    * define elements
    */

    get usernameInput()   { return $('//*[@name="username"]'); }
    get passwordInput()   { return $('//*[@name="password"]'); }
    get rememberMe ()     { return $('//*[@id="remember-me"]'); }
    get loginButton()     { return $('//button[contains(., "Login")]'); }

    /**
     * define or overwrite page methods
     */
    open () {
        super.open('login')
        //browser.pause(3000);
    }
    /**
     * your page specific methods
     */
    login (username, password) {
      this.usernameInput.setValue(username);
      this.passwordInput.setValue(password);
      this.rememberMe.click();
      this.loginButton.click();
    }
}

module.exports = new LoginPage();

```

### Working with DataBase

A relational database is, simply, a database that stores related information across multiple tables and allows you to query information in more than one table at the same time. Your application under test displays data from these database. So when you are actually performing automation testing it is very likely that you need to verify the data between actual (which you got it from browser) Vs expected (which you will get it from the database by executing SQL statements on database). This can be done by below statements in your code.
```
//example of connection to Oracle DataBase

var  db   = require('node-any-jdbc');

cogfig = {
  libpath: './config/drivers/oracle/ojdbc7.jar',
  drivername: 'oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver',
  url:  'jdbc:oracle:thin:QA/password123@//abc-test.corp.int:1527/stage1',
  // uri: 'jdbc:oracle:thin://abc-test.corp.int:1527/stage1',
  // user: 'QA',
  // password: 'password123',
};

//example of sample select query to fetch the result set

var sql = 'SELECT * FROM emp_info where emp_id = "1001"';
db.execute(cogfig, sql, function(results){
  console.log(results);
});

For trouble shooting and more information, please visit `node-any-jdbc` module which can be [found here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-any-jdbc)

Note: `node-any-jdbc` is NOT packaged under this project. If you need, you can install it and start using it right away. You can also find sample examples under /util-examples/database-example.js

```

### Working with MS-Excel

You can user MS-Excel and store your test data, expected data in an excel sheet. Tou can keeep any number of excel sheets you want and use below common methods to puull data from youe sheet to be use as part of testing.  Please note it only support .xlsx file format. For more information refer to the `common-utilities.js` and `util-examples`

```
//example of pulling data from MS-Excel

var  utl  = require('../utilities/common-utilities.js');
utl.excel_getTableRow(__dirname+'/sample.xlsx', 'info', 'emp_id', '101', function(results){
  // returns only one row based on the condition
  //console.log(results);
  //console.log(results.emp_id);
});

utl.excel_getTableRows(__dirname+'/sample.xlsx', 'address', function(results){
  // returns all rows of the specified sheet
  //console.log(results[1]);
  //then do what ever validation you to do withe results
});

utl.excel_getAllSheetData(__dirname+'/sample.xlsx', function(results){
  // returns all sheets data of a excel file
  //console.log(results);
  //then do what ever validation you to do withe results
});
```

### Common utilities

Refer to the common Javascript functions that provides clean, performant methods for manipulating objects, collections, MS-Excel utilities, DataBase utilities etc. Few sample code can be found in ./util-examples/

Use [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) already bundled inside the framework which provides over 100 functions that support both your favorite workaday functional helpers: map, filter, invoke â€” as well as more specialized goodies: function binding, javascript templating, creating quick indexes, deep equality testing, and so on.

## History

Industry is moving towards Node.js / JavaScript, Angularjs, Full-Stack world. WebdriverIO, a JavaScript binding wrapper for Selenium Webdriver, was originated by Camilo Tapia's initial Selenium project called WebdriverJS, which was the first Webdriver project on NPM. In 2014, the project was renamed WebdriverIO later on. This repository is a pre-configured version of webdriverIO meant to jump-start the process of writing new test automation or adding test automation to existing node.js applications.
